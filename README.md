This project was instrumental in teaching me how to integrate JavaScript and CSS animations seamlessly. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in creating a calming and soothing web application using Vanilla JavaScript.

Technologies Used:

* CSS
* HTML
* JavaScript

Lessons Learned:

* Worked extensively with JavaScript setInterval() function to control animation speed and timing
* Mastered the use of CSS Keyframes and Pointers for smooth transitions and animations
* Avoided common mistakes such as forgetting to close brackets properly in Conic Gradients, ensuring optimal performance in the HTML preview
